# NorthCoders Front-End

## Description

This is the backend to the Northcoder News App project. The front-end can be found here:
https://github.com/ercrawshaw/nc_news.git

This application presents a page of news article cards to the user which can be viewed by topic and sorted by votes, timestamp and comment count. When an article card is chosen the user can view the entire article, vote on it, comment on it and view other users comments.

For this project I used react, axios, bootstrap and netlify.
